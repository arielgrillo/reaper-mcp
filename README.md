# REAPER MCP

## Purpose

REAPER MCP exposes the active REAPER project to MCP clients through a small,
explicit runtime chain:

```text
MCP client
-> Python MCP server
-> TCP/JSON bridge
-> REAPER ReaScript
-> REAPER API
```

The external server in `src/reaper_mcp/` defines typed MCP tools and exchanges
JSON with `127.0.0.1:8765`. It never calls REAPER APIs directly. The bridge in
`reaper/mcp_bridge.py` runs inside REAPER, owns every `RPR_*` call, validates
REAPER targets, and reads or mutates the project.

## Requirements

- Python as configured by `.python-version` and `pyproject.toml`.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python environments and dependencies.
- REAPER with Python/ReaScript support configured.
- Node.js and npm for the MCP Inspector launcher (`npx`).
- Codex is optional contributor tooling, not a runtime dependency.

## Setup

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/arielgrillo/reaper-mcp.git
Set-Location reaper-mcp
uv sync
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/deploy_reaper_bridge.ps1
```

Configure REAPER to use the Python runtime required by this repository, then
load and run the deployed `mcp_bridge.py` as a ReaScript. The bridge must remain
running while MCP tools are used.

Launch the MCP Inspector from the repository root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/start_mcp_inspector.ps1
```

Inspector remains responsible for starting the configured stdio MCP server.
Launch the backlog visualizer at <http://localhost:8000> with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/start_backlog_visualizer.ps1
```

## Architecture

### MCP server

`src/reaper_mcp/server.py`:

- exposes MCP tools and typed arguments;
- runs as an external stdio MCP process;
- sends one JSON command per TCP connection to `127.0.0.1:8765`;
- reads the complete bridge response with a finite timeout;
- contains no direct `RPR_*` calls.

### REAPER bridge

`reaper/mcp_bridge.py`:

- runs inside REAPER as a deferred Python ReaScript;
- owns all direct `RPR_*` interaction;
- resolves one-based public indexes to REAPER objects;
- implements focused handlers registered in `COMMAND_HANDLERS`;
- validates requests and returns structured JSON results or errors;
- performs both read-only inspection and explicit mutations.

## Contract conventions

- Public track, item, take, FX, parameter, envelope, note, marker, and routing
  indexes are one-based unless a field explicitly says it is a raw REAPER value.
- Useful raw REAPER values remain available alongside readable values: track
  volume raw plus dB, pan raw plus percentage/direction, and FX normalized plus
  formatted values.
- Musical positions come from REAPER time-map APIs, so tempo and time-signature
  changes are respected rather than reconstructed from BPM.
- MIDI note names use the convention where pitch 60 is `C4`, 24 is `C1`, and
  26 is `D1`. A note accepts exactly one of `note_name` or numeric `pitch`.
- Item GUIDs provide stable identity for destructive item operations.
- Mutations validate explicit targets and inputs, read the applied state back,
  and reject invalid values instead of silently clamping them.
- Item creation rejects overlap with any existing item on the target track.
  Adjacent items that only touch at a boundary are allowed.
- Destructive MIDI replacement validates the complete payload before clearing
  any existing MIDI events and keeps a rollback snapshot.

## MIDI contracts

### Create a MIDI item

The item uses absolute, one-based project measures. `end_measure` is exclusive.
Every note uses a one-based measure relative to the beginning of that item:

```json
{
  "track_index": 9,
  "start_measure": 3,
  "end_measure": 5,
  "notes": [
    {
      "note_name": "C4",
      "start_measure": 1,
      "start_beat": 1.0,
      "duration_qn": 1.0,
      "velocity": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

Use exactly one of `note_name` or `pitch` in each note. `duration_qn` is in
quarter-note units. Notes sharing a start position form a chord; gaps and
overlaps are allowed. REAPER time-map and MIDI PPQ conversion remain internal.

### Create a text note item

`create_note_item` creates an empty MediaItem with text stored in `P_NOTES`.
It creates no audio/MIDI take and rejects blank text or an occupied time range.

### Replace MIDI content

`replace_midi_item_content` targets an existing active MIDI take by one-based
track plus exact item GUID and uses the same relative note shape. It validates
the entire payload before clearing notes, CC/pitch/program/pressure events, and
text/sysex. `notes: []` is an explicit clear operation that leaves the item in
place. The item GUID, position, length, mute, and lock state are verified after
replacement.

## End-to-end examples

The examples show a possible MCP client workflow; indexes and GUIDs come from
earlier responses.

1. Inspect the project with `get_project_info` using `{}`, then list tracks with
   `get_tracks` using `{}`.
2. Inspect FX with `get_track_fx`, then call `get_fx_parameter` with
   `{"track_index": 2, "fx_index": 1, "parameter_index": 3}`.
3. Apply a readable value with `set_fx_parameter_formatted` and
   `{"track_index": 2, "fx_index": 1, "parameter_index": 3,
   "formatted_value": "-2 dB"}`.
4. Create a two-measure text item with
   `{"track_index": 9, "start_measure": 3, "duration_measures": 2,
   "text": "Am7"}`.
5. Create a chord by sending C4, E4, and G4 notes with the same relative
   `start_measure` and `start_beat` to `create_midi_item`.
6. Take the returned `item_guid` and send a complete new note list to
   `replace_midi_item_content`; old MIDI events are not merged or appended.

## Safety and mutation behavior

- All mutations resolve and validate their explicit track/FX/item targets.
- Values are checked before mutation and read back before success is reported.
- Inputs outside supported ranges are errors rather than silently clamped.
- Initial tempo and meter writes preserve later tempo-map events. Setting meter
  inserts a time-zero marker only when the project has no initial marker,
  because REAPER stores an explicit time-signature change in a tempo marker.
- Internal tempo-map writes create or update only the event at the requested
  musical position and preserve omitted tempo or meter state. They do not
  support gradual/linear tempo changes.
- Region boundaries are one-based project measures and `end_measure` is
  exclusive. Track creation appends unless a valid insertion index is supplied.
- New note and MIDI items reject overlap; boundary-touching items are valid.
- Failed MIDI-item creation cleans up a partially created item.
- MIDI replacement is explicitly destructive, validates before clearing, and
  restores a captured item chunk when an unexpected post-clear failure occurs.
- Creation and replacement are separate operations; there is no hidden
  create-or-update behavior.

## Development workflow

- Read `AGENTS.md` before contributing; it defines architecture, validation,
  deployment, Git, backlog, and README-maintenance rules.
- Deploy bridge changes with
  `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/deploy_reaper_bridge.ps1`.
- Launch Inspector with `scripts/start_mcp_inspector.ps1` and the backlog UI
  with `scripts/start_backlog_visualizer.ps1`.
- The repository-local capability workflow is in
  `.codex/skills/add-reaper-mcp-capability/SKILL.md`.
- Validate external code with `uv run python -m compileall src`; bridge changes
  also require deployment and runtime testing in REAPER.

## Backlog

`tasks/backlog.json` tracks planned, testing, and explicitly accepted work. The
visualizer reads it directly. The implementation remains the source of truth
for runtime behavior; the README does not duplicate the full backlog.

## Known limitations

- Formatted FX parameter writes use deterministic inversion of REAPER's
  formatter. They support continuous displays with one numeric value and unit;
  textual choices or displays containing multiple numbers may require a direct
  normalized value.
- Preset inspection exposes the current preset name and total count where
  REAPER provides them; it does not enumerate every preset name.
- The TCP bridge is local, single-request, and tied to the active REAPER project;
  the ReaScript must be running for all REAPER-backed tools.
